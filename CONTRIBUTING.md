Roadmap
----------
Delly still lacks an adequate copy-number segmentation algorithm which is currently under development. We also would love to incorporate the alignment viewers, suave and maze, into our [GEAR genomics](https://www.gear-genomics.com) platform ([https://www.gear-genomics.com](https://www.gear-genomics.com)) but currently lack man-power. If you are interested in contributing please get in touch with <a href="https://www-db.embl.de/EMBLPersonGroup-PersonPicture/MailForm/?recipient=CP-60010497">me</a>, thanks!
